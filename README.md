# College PHP

Since the college machines do not have PHP installed, I have included PHP v8.1.13 inside this repository.

## PHP

To get PHP working on the machine you need to open cmd to the folder containing this repository and type `setup.bat`.
This will run a few commands to setup php and allow the cli to work hopefully without issues.

> PHP will only work in that terminal session, if you close cmd at all you will need to re-run the script.

## SQLite browser

This repositoy also includes SQLite browser, which can be used to view sqlite databases.
